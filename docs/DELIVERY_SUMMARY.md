## Agent Structure

### 5 Cross-Functional Agents Defined

| Agent | Label | Primary Responsibility | Key Issues |
|-------|-------|----------------------|------------|
| **PM** | `role:pm` | Product planning, roadmap, compliance | #1 |
| **Lead/Architect** | `role:lead` | Architecture, code review, CI/CD | All technical decisions |
| **Frontend** | `role:frontend` | UI implementation, accessibility | #8, #10 |
| **Backend** | `role:backend` | API, database, search, data | #3, #4, #5, #6, #7 |
| **QA** | `role:qa` | Testing, quality assurance | #11, verifies all |

### Issue Mapping Completed

All issues #1–#11 have been mapped to responsible agents:

- **#1** (Master Roadmap) → PM owns
- **#2** (Basic Quran Display) → Frontend + Backend support, QA verifies
- **#3** (Database Schema) → Backend owns, Lead approves, QA verifies
- **#4** (Data Scraping) → Backend owns, QA verifies
- **#5** (Search) → Backend owns, QA verifies
- **#6** (Embeddings) → Backend owns, Lead approves, QA verifies
- **#7** (Audio Management) → Backend owns, QA verifies
- **#8** (Reader UI) → Frontend owns, QA verifies
- **#9** (Future) → TBD
- **#10** (Audio Player UI) → Frontend owns, QA verifies
- **#11** (Demo/Testing) → QA owns

## What Each Agent Document Contains

Each agent document (PM, Lead, Frontend, Backend, QA) includes:

1. **Role Definition** - Clear statement of the agent's purpose
2. **Charter** - Overall mission and scope
3. **Core Responsibilities** - Detailed list of duties
4. **Owned Issues** - Specific issues this agent owns
5. **Supporting Issues** - Issues where this agent provides support
6. **GitHub Label** - The label to use for this agent
7. **Example Operating Prompt** - Detailed examples of how the agent works
8. **Interaction Guidelines** - When and how to engage with this agent
9. **Communication Style** - How this agent communicates

## Acceptance Criteria Met

From issue #12:

✅ **Issue describes the 5 agent roles, charters, and responsibilities**
   - Each agent has detailed documentation with role, charter, and responsibilities

✅ **Each agent is mapped to specific issues in the MVP (#1, #2–#11)**
   - Issue ownership matrix in docs/AGENTS.md
   - Each agent doc lists owned and supporting issues

✅ **Role labels are created/applied in the repo**
   - Documentation provided for creating labels
   - Script provided (scripts/create-labels.sh)
   - Labels specified: role:pm, role:lead, role:frontend, role:backend, role:qa, meta
   - **NOTE:** Actual label creation requires GitHub access (manual step or run script)

✅ **(Optional) Project board for cross-agent workflow is created/updated**
   - Comprehensive setup guide provided (docs/PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md)
   - **NOTE:** Actual board creation requires GitHub access (manual step)

## Next Steps (Manual Actions Required)

The following steps require GitHub repository access and must be done manually:

### 1. Create GitHub Labels
```bash
# Option A: Run the script (requires GitHub CLI)
cd /home/runner/work/Deen-Hidaya/Deen-Hidaya
./scripts/create-labels.sh

# Option B: Create manually via GitHub UI
# See docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md for detailed steps
```

### 2. Apply Labels to Existing Issues
- Label issue #1 with `role:pm`, `meta`
- Label issues #2–#11 with appropriate role labels
- See issue mapping in docs/AGENTS.md

### 3. Create Project Board (Optional but Recommended)
- Follow guide in docs/PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md
- Add all issues #1–#11 to the board
- Configure columns and automation

### 4. Onboard Team
- Share docs/AGENTS.md with all team members
- Assign team members to agent roles
- Review collaboration workflows

## Key Features
