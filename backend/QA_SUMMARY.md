## Known Issues

### Non-Critical
1. **Test Fixture Conflicts** - test_embeddings.py has failures when run with other suites
   - **Impact:** Low - tests pass independently
   - **Resolution:** Run test files separately or refactor fixtures

2. **Deprecation Warnings** - SQLAlchemy and Pydantic warnings
   - **Impact:** None - warnings only, no functional issues
   - **Resolution:** Update API patterns in future refactor

### By Design (Not Issues)
- Semantic search requires embeddings (falls back gracefully)
- Admin token in plain text (development only)
- SQLite for tests (production uses PostgreSQL)
