## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **Credentials Protection:** 
   - Tunnel credentials are excluded from git via `.gitignore`
   - Never commit `*.json` files or `cloudflared-config.yml`

2. **Access Control:**
   - Temporary tunnels are public to anyone with the URL
   - Consider Cloudflare Access for authentication
   - Monitor access logs regularly

3. **Exposure:**
   - Only frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8000) are exposed
   - Database remains local and protected
   - Review what data is accessible through the tunnel

4. **Best Practices:**
   - Only share URLs with trusted individuals
   - Stop tunnels when not in use
   - Use temporary tunnels for quick sharing
   - Implement proper authentication before wide sharing

## Testing Checklist

Before creating the issue, verify:

- [x] Helper script is executable (`chmod +x`)
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and clear
- [x] Configuration example is well-commented
- [x] Security warnings are prominent
- [x] Links between documents work correctly
- [x] .gitignore prevents credential commits
- [ ] Script has been tested locally (manual verification needed)
- [ ] Tunnels work with running services (manual verification needed)

## Next Steps

1. **Merge this PR** to add documentation and tooling
2. **Create the GitHub issue** using the template
3. **Test the setup** following the quick start guide
4. **Share with friends** to gather feedback
5. **Iterate** based on usage and feedback

## Architecture Notes

As the Lead/Architect agent, this implementation:

- ‚úÖ Provides infrastructure for early sharing without full deployment
- ‚úÖ Maintains security through proper credential handling
- ‚úÖ Offers both quick (temporary) and persistent options
- ‚úÖ Includes comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Follows project conventions and structure
- ‚úÖ Doesn't require changes to application code
- ‚úÖ Can be easily enabled/disabled as needed

This is appropriate for the early MVP phase where the goal is to gather feedback from friends before investing in full production deployment infrastructure.
