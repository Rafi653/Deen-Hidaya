If you encounter missing translations or Q&A not working:

**[‚Üí Quick Fix Guide](./QUICKFIX_GUIDE.md)** - Complete step-by-step guide to fix:
1. Missing English/Telugu translations
2. Q&A functionality not working
3. Embeddings generation

**Time**: 15-30 minutes | **Cost**: ~$0.03 for embeddings

See also: [Detailed Troubleshooting Guide](./backend/FIXES_README.md)

### Quick Start (Automated Setup)

**Recommended:** Use the automated setup script for a complete one-command setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rafi653/Deen-Hidaya.git
cd Deen-Hidaya
./setup.sh
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Create `.env` file from template
- ‚úÖ Start Docker services (PostgreSQL, Backend, Frontend)
- ‚úÖ Run database migrations
- ‚úÖ Ingest Quran data (if not already present)
- ‚úÖ Optionally generate embeddings for Q&A
- ‚úÖ Verify all services are healthy

After setup completes:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432

### Quick Start (Manual Setup)

If you prefer manual setup:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rafi653/Deen-Hidaya.git
cd Deen-Hidaya
```

2. Copy the environment example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start all services with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

5. Ingest data (if not already done):
```bash
docker compose exec backend python ingest_data.py
```

### Health Checks

Verify all services are running:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000/api/health
- Backend: http://localhost:8000/health

### Development

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

See individual README files in `frontend/` and `backend/` directories for more details.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ‚ùå "Translation not available" in frontend
**Fix**: Run the translation fix script to get correct English and Telugu translations.
```bash
docker compose exec backend python fix_translations.py --force
```

#### ‚ùå Q&A page not working
**Fix**: Generate embeddings with your OpenAI API key.
```bash
# Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env first
docker compose exec backend python fix_embeddings.py
```

#### ‚ùå Services not starting
**Fix**: Check Docker logs and ensure ports are free.
```bash
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs frontend
docker compose restart
```
